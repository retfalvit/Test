# Test
Short description of the solution. Please read and check the codes in the notebooks.

For folders I used a storage account in Azure which had been mounted to Databricks DBFS.

Simulated on prem server by Azure SQL Server instance-

- Task 1a:
I would use the Databricks notebook in an ADF pipeline and triggered that by storage event trigger.

- Task 1b:
I would run the Databricks notebook by manually/create a job for the notebook in Databricks/Trigger now in ADF.

- Task 1c:
I would run the ADF pipeline. Please see the screenshoot and go through the Databricks notebooks where I included the solution from Azure SQL/ADF.

- Task 2-3:
I included the solution to the Databricks notebook from Azure SQL.
